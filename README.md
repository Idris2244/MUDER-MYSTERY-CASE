### Project Overview

This project aims to analyze a comprehensive dataset related to a murder investigation. The dataset includes various tables that provide insights into the crime scene, suspect profiles, social interactions, and more. Our goal is to extract information about the murder, identify potential suspects, and uncover the mastermind behind the crime.

The data for this project was collected from a police station and includes several key tables. The Crime Scene Report Table details the circumstances of the murder, while the Driver License Table helps identify potential suspects. The Facebook Event Check-in Table reveals social media interactions around the time of the crime. Additionally, the Get Fit Now Check-in Table and Get Fit Now Member Table provide insights into fitness-related activities and memberships that may link individuals. The Income Table offers financial information for potential motive analysis, and the Interview Table contains transcripts from discussions with witnesses and suspects. Lastly, the Person Table serves as a directory of individuals relevant to the investigation, creating a comprehensive framework for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the murder_Mystery_Case to answer key Question, Such as:

- Who is the murderer

### Result And Findings 

- Security footage reveals that two witnesses were present during the incident. The first witness resides at the last house on Northwestern Drive, while the second witness, identified as Annabel, lives on Franklin Avenue. Their testimonies could provide crucial insights into the events that transpired.
- The first witness stated that they heard a gunshot and subsequently saw a man fleeing the scene with a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. Notably, the membership number on the bag began with "48Z," which is exclusive to gold members. The man then entered a vehicle with a license plate that included "H42W." The second witness provided a more direct account, claiming to have witnessed the murder and recognizing the perpetrator from their gym during a workout on January 9th. This information could be vital in identifying the suspect and establishing a timeline of events.
- After thorough analysis, it was determined that the murderer is Jeremy Bowers, who claimed he was hired by an unidentified woman with significant financial resources. He described her as being approximately 5'5" to 5'7" tall, with red hair, and driving a Tesla Model S. Additionally, he noted that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert three times in December 2017. By cross-referencing the Driving License ID Table, Person Table, and Facebook Event Check-in Table, I identified the mastermind behind the crime as Miranda Priestly. This comprehensive investigation highlights the intricate connections between the individuals involved and provides crucial insights into the case.
